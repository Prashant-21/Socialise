# Socialise
This is my first project on using Core Java, XML and Firebase. 
I developed this application to implement my knowledge of Android Development as a beginner.
Though it's just a beginer level project as I'm new to Android Developemnt.
This application is inspired by instagram in terms of User-Interface and User-Experience.
To provide additional features few open-source repositories have been used such as social view, android image cropper, etc.
Firebase realtime database, storage, authentication etc are used on the back-end of this application.
