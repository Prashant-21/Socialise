# Socialise

This is my first project using Core Java, XML, and Firebase. 
I developed this application to implement my knowledge of Android Development as a beginner. Though it's just a beginner level project as I'm new to Android Development. This application is inspired by Instagram in terms of User-Interface and User-Experience. To provide additional features few open-source repositories have been used such as social view, android image cropper, etc. A bit of animation can be seen on launching this application before the welcome page appears. Images can be uploaded in real-time with content description either from apps like gallery or from the camera in this app and images can be cropped freely before posting. Firebase realtime database, storage, authentication etc are used on the back-end of this application.
